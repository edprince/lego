#Bluetooth#
Despite getting the bluetooth working with one app earlier on in the process,
we needed to use bluetooth and a certain app to interact with the robot
successfully. The new app allows us to send/recieve messages to and from the
robot, and should not at all interfere with the existing program on the robot
itself. 

#Gameplay#
We have also changed the gameplay slightly. After conversing with the tutors, we
realised that we needed to add more complexity. Since the line following was
presenting many difficulties (due to the placement of the sensor, and the tracks
on the robot), we decided to focus more heavily on an adaptable-maze-solving
robot. The maze shall be built using large square tiles with different tape
pathways. The tile approach allows us to change/adapt the maze and prove that
our robot can still solve it. To make the game more interactable with users, we
have decided to place different types of object in the maze, and make the user
decide which objects to pick up/where to put them. This can be done with the
bluetooth messaging.
