Coming to the end of the project, we are hitting a number of problems with
regards to the success of our game. The robot is not consistently performing the
maze as we would have wished, it still does not successfully pick up objects.

There are been significant improvements since uniforming all of the tiles. Now
we are just constantly tweaking the project to attempt to make it consistent. 

The presentation is coming along well. I have created a website to present our
work on, this includes slides with abstracted information to talk from, as well
as embedded YouTube videos and an embedded animation to demonstrate the
algorithm that was developed and integrated by Stefan. The Bluetooth is all
working correctly, the mini-game plays consistently, and the end set-up is
working.

We now just need to rehearse the presentation a little more, and with a bit of
tweaking, we'll be good to go!
