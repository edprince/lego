#Live Demo to the Group#
This week, we demonstrated our game to the rest of the groups. Despite having
made it through the maze a number of times before this, like a true technical
demo, everything went wrong... The robot was not able to get through about 2
tiles, let alone make it to the end of the maze. We weren't able to demo the
object pick-up and reposition within the maze, and even the end (which had been
fine every time we tried previously, broke. It wasn't able to position the
object at the correct destination, nor was it able to put it down correctly
consistently. In short, there was a lot that needed improving. We have started
off by making the tiles far more accurate and consistent. They are now exactly
$57cm^2$, and the maze lines are exactly straight, and intersect at the precise
mid-point. 

This has caused a dramatic improvement on the consistency of the robot. He now
does not come off the maze, as he was before. More changes have been made with
regards to the distance that the infra-red sensor scans at the end of the maze,
which should cause the robot to consistently find the maximum of three
destination points.
