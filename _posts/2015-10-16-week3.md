#Movement#
This week we have added looped movement to the robot, so it will
continuously move, and (mostly) doesn't crash into any walls. Exceptions
have proven to be irregular objects like legs/chairs etc. It proves very
successful with regular walls though.

This week we have also successfully implemented mobile phone controlled
movement for the robot. This would allow the user to connect their phone
to the robot via bluetooth, and control the motors.

We have drawn up flow charts for the game.
