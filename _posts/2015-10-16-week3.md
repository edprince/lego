#Movement#
This week we have added looped movement to the robot, so it will
continuously move, and (mostly) doesn't crash into any walls. Exceptions
have proven to be irregular objects like legs/chairs etc. It proves very
successful with regular walls though.

This week we have also successfully implemented mobile phone controlled
movement for the robot. This would allow the user to connect their phone
to the robot via bluetooth, and control the motors.

#Update to movement#
Due to complexity and possible conflicts between the loaded program and
phone instructions, we have decided to attempt to automate the maze.
This will include implementing line following. We will also automate the
acquisition and transportation of the objects.
