#The robot#
This week we have finished building the robot, and added a touch and
optical sensor. We have also tested the optical and infra-red sensors
stopping the robot from crashing into walls. The optical sensor has
allowed us to react to detection of any of a selection of colours. 

We have also decided on our game as a maze, in which the robot has to
navigate, and react with various objects. This approach allows us to
have a reasonable amount of modularity for new obstacles in the maze.
